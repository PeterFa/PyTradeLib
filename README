================================================================================

PyTradeLab is a python library for managing instrument data, screening and
backtesting. It stands on the shoulders of a giant: PyAlgoTrade, authored by
Gabriel Martin Becedillas Ruiz. Many thanks to him for his excellent work!!

So what's different?
- The entire API is a more pythonic lower_cased_api.
- Everything uses new-style classes now.
- Newly added files are licensed under the LGPLv3+.
- Python properties should be used in preference over getter/setter functions.
- Added a super-pre-alpha GUI application for charting and plotting Strategies.
- Symbol Data Management in general got completely rewritten and expanded:
  - Downloading of data for more than one symbol at a time sees huge performance
    increases.
  - Data is (optionally) kept automatically updated by a daemon running in the
    background, or manually by a convenience script.
  - Underlying data structures have been converted to numpy arrays for better
    performance, memory usage and integration with talib.
  - Memory usage while backtesting with many symbols is significantly decreased.

TODO:
- Add timezone support across the board.
- Lots of work on StrategyAnalyzers left to do.
- Convert storage of non-historical data to SQL.
- Convert testing to nosetests.
- Work on improving local multiprocessing optimizer.
- Then work on improving local network multiprocessing optimizer.

Regressions:
- The homegrown indicators from PyAlgoTrade have been removed.
- For the time being, googleappengine support has also been removed.
